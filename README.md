## Overview

The main goal of UHelper is to assist with time management and wellness. 
Users can create events for exams or assignments at specified times and details. Once scheduled, 
the bot will notify users individually in direct messages a day before the events. 
For study assistance, they can input questions and answers for UHelper to quiz them later, 
with optional hints available. To help boost students‚Äô productivity and focus, 
the bot can set up a Pomodoro timer, including customizable presets and collaborative features that 
allow multiple users to have a timer in common to work remotely.

The bot supports student wellness by suggesting healthy and handy cooking recipes based on given 
ingredients. If requested, the bot can also display nutritional facts about each dish. Additionally,
users can subscribe to receive daily motivational quotes and mental health tips. During breaks, 
users can engage in mini-games, which track their records, to stay entertained. Finally, 
to avoid command conflicts with other bots in the server, users can customize UHelper's command 
lines. The customizability ensures a seamless and non-disruptive experience across various 
functionalities.

## Installation Guide

### Before You Start: Setting Up a Discord Server.

In order to install UHelper, you have to create your own server or are already an administrator in 
an existing server. If you have not used Discord before or do not know how to work with servers, it 
is recommended that you read through [this beginner's guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord#h_efc9b7bc-47bc-4212-8b9c-c0fa76573cfe).

### How to Invite UHelper to Your Server

If you can see a screen similar as above, that means you've successfully created your own server. 
You are now ready to invite UHelper to help you through your journey as a student. This 
[link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1253813199397191863&permissions=1126727225142272&integration_type=0&scope=bot) will take you to a webpage that prompts you to select which server you want UHelper to
join. 

![png](assets/1.png)

Here, you can select the server you want (it's under the Add to Server section!) and afterward, 
press continue.

Then, you will be asked to confirm that you wish to grant some permissions to UHelper. Because these 
are all essential for the bot to function, you should not uncheck any one of them. Scroll
down to the bottom to find the "authorize" button and click it.

Seeing this screen means that UHelper has successfully joined your server. Congratulations! The next
part of this guide will teach you how to run UHelper.

### How to Run UHelper in a Server

![png](assets/4.png)

UHelper joined the server, but it cannot listen to your commands as it is not online. Open up 
IntelliJ IDEA and go to ca.unknown.bot.app.Main. Go to Edit Configurations, click Add new run 
configuration, and select Application.

![png](assets/5.png)

In the edit configuration window, choose Java 11 and Project.Main under the Build and Run section.
For the main class box, type ca.unknown.bot.app.Main. Next, importantly, you should add some bot 
tokens as an environmental variable... but where are the tokens, you ask? Discord enforces 
strict rules to its bot developers and one of them is that you can't post
any bot token online due to security reasons. If you do, it will immediately detect the token and 
automatically disable it. But, you can still have access to the UHelper's tokens! We've attached the 
tokens via the comment section of the Phase 1 submission.

Once you find the tokens, set them up as the environmental variables. To do so, type TYPE={your_token}
in the environmental variables box, as shown in the above screenshot. Click the apply button to save 
these changes. Finally, run the main.java class.

A successful execution of UHelper should look like this. Then, open Discord and go to your server.
The UHelper bot should be online in your server. Stopping UHelper in IntelliJ will cause it to go 
offline.

Most of the UHelper's features are slash commands interaction, so you can type / in the chat to see 
the list of commands it offers! Please note that, as of July 30, some features are not implemented 
yet.
