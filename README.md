# Welcome to UHelper! ü§ñ (last updated on July 12)

UHelper is an interactive bot that is designed to meet students' needs on Discord.

## Overview üìñ

The main goal of UHelper is to assist with time management and wellness. 
Users can create events for tests or assignments at specified times and details. Once scheduled, 
the bot will notify users individually in direct messages a day before the events. 
For study assistance, they can input questions and answers for UHelper to quiz them later, 
with optional hints available. To help boost students‚Äô productivity and focus, 
the bot can set up a Pomodoro timer, including customizable presets and collaborative features that 
allow multiple users to have a timer in common to work remotely.

The bot supports student wellness by suggesting healthy and handy cooking recipes based on given 
ingredients. If requested, the bot can also display nutritional facts about each dish. Additionally,
users can subscribe to receive daily motivational quotes and mental health tips. During breaks, 
users can engage in mini-games, which track their records, to stay entertained. Finally, 
to avoid command conflicts with other bots in the server, users can customize UHelper's command 
lines. The customizability ensures a seamless and non-disruptive experience across various 
functionalities.
