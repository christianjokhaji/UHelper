# Welcome!

UHelper is an interactive bot that is designed to meet students' needs on Discord.

Currently, we plan to implement the following features:

Important Deadlines:
July 11 - Phase 1
August 8 - Phase 2 & Final Presentation


As a reminder, here are our user stories that we have to implement.

Team Story: 
I am a UofT student and want help keeping track of my schedule. I call the bot to create a schedule 
and give it a set of important times to note down. The bot will then notify me in direct messages 
at these times to help me manage my time. 


Mustafa’s Story: 
I want to maintain my mental health and positively start my day. I call the bot to 
receive daily motivational quotes and mental health tips.

Example: 
I want to receive a motivational quote every morning to help me start my day on a positive 
note. I also want to get tips on managing stress and practicing mindfulness. I call the bot to 
subscribe to daily quotes and tips. Every morning, the bot sends me a new motivational quote and 
a mental health tip via direct message, helping me stay motivated and mentally healthy throughout 
my studies.

Aria’s Story: 
I want to be given reminders of upcoming exams. I call the bot to create new exam events. 
The chatbot sends me direct message notifications a day before my exam, showing me the exam's 
subject, writing location, and time. 

Dusan’s Story: 
I want to call the bot for study help and give it a set of questions and answers for it to later 
quiz me on. The bot can also provide me with hints, upon request.

Example: 
I am studying for the CSC207 midterm and want help remembering terms, so I write down questions, 
answers, and respective hints and give them to the bot to later test me on. I then request the bot 
using a command like !study, to state the questions back to me to test if I retained the knowledge, 
giving hints if requested. The bot provides the various questions in a random order.

Min's story: 
I want to set up a Pomodoro study timer which will notify me at the end of each working session or 
study break. The bot prompts me to select how many times I want the timer to repeat, and I can 
enter a custom amount of time (in minutes) that I want to spend working, and also on break. 
To promote collaboration within the server, I can invite others to share the same timer. 
Users will be notified individually when the work/break is over via direct message. 
At any point, I can cancel the timer.

Xinyue(Cindy)’s story: 
To stay healthy, I want to be able to call the bot for cooking help. The bot should provide recipes 
and nutritional information for the food I have on hand, helping me quickly and easily make 
nutritious meals.

Example: 
A user desires to know possible recipes for preparing a chicken and some vegetables, they then call 
the bot to suggest related recipes. The bot can also show the user the nutrition facts about each 
dish if requested.

Christian’s story: 
I want to play mini-games from a preselected list whenever I have a break/free time. I call the bot 
to play a mini-game with me and we interact back-and-forth until the game is finished. It keeps 
score against me and shows our record after each match. 

Example: 
!play {name_of_game}

Story: 
I have multiple bots in my server which use conflicting commands. I change the call command 
for this bot to minimize interference. 

Example: 
Set the call as !c or !p
